# My Awesome Project

This project is a collaborative effort between me and my friend [UbayyahEmailAnalyzer](https://github.com/UbayyahEmailAnalyzer/Ubayyah).

## Overview
Ubayyah Email Analyzer is an email security tool designed to evaluate the authenticity and potential risks of an email. Using various checks, it assesses the emailâ€™s sender, content, attachments, and links to identify suspicious elements that may indicate phishing or other malicious intentions.
